# Indigenous‑Led Climate Solutions in Canada

This fact sheet highlights the critical role of Indigenous leadership in climate action and provides examples of Indigenous‑led initiatives across Canada. It also offers guidance for non‑Indigenous allies on how to support these efforts in a respectful, reciprocal way.

## Why Indigenous Leadership Is Essential
- **Deep Connection to Land**: Indigenous peoples have lived in relationship with their territories for millennia, developing sophisticated knowledge systems for sustainable stewardship.
- **Legal & Moral Rights**: Indigenous Nations hold inherent rights and title to their lands, waters, and resources. Climate solutions that ignore these rights are illegitimate and colonial.
- **Proven Solutions**: Indigenous communities are already implementing some of the most innovative, place‑based climate responses—from renewable‑energy projects to land‑back movements.

## Examples of Indigenous‑Led Climate Solutions

### 1. Renewable Energy Projects
- **T'Sou‑ke Nation (BC)**: One of Canada’s first solar‑powered communities, with solar hot‑water systems, photovoltaic arrays, and a micro‑grid that exports clean energy to the provincial grid.
- **Cowessess First Nation (SK)**: Co‑owners of the 200 MW **Bekevar Wind Farm**, a partnership that provides revenue, jobs, and energy sovereignty.
- **Mi'kmaq Nation (NS)**: The **Membertou Geothermal** project, using abandoned mine shafts to provide low‑carbon heating and cooling.

### 2. Land‑Back & Stewardship Initiatives
- **Łutsël K'é Dene First Nation (NT)**: Established the **Thaidene Nëné Indigenous Protected Area**, a 26,000 km² conservation area co‑managed with Parks Canada that protects boreal forest and caribou habitat.
- **Gitxaala Nation (BC)**: Asserting sovereignty over marine resources through **Gitxaala‑led marine‑use planning**, integrating traditional laws with modern conservation science.
- **Mushkegowuk Council (ON)**: Leading the **Moose Cree‑led peatland restoration** to revive carbon‑rich wetlands degraded by industrial activity.

### 3. Food Sovereignty & Traditional Knowledge
- **Dehcho First Nations (NT)**: Revitalizing **caribou‑stewardship programs** that combine Dene knowledge with western science to monitor and protect herds.
- **Mi'kmaw Conservation Group (NS)**: Restoring **eel‑grass beds** and **clam‑garden** traditions that sequester carbon, enhance biodiversity, and strengthen local food systems.
- **Inuit‑Led Arctic Monitoring**: **Inuit‑Circumpolar Council** and **Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami** are leading research on sea‑ice loss, permafrost thaw, and community‑based adaptation.

## How Non‑Indigenous Allies Can Support

### Do:
- **Listen & Follow**: Let Indigenous communities set their own priorities. Your role is to support, not lead.
- **Build Long‑Term Relationships**: Move beyond transactional solidarity. Show up consistently and commit for the long haul.
- **Redirect Resources**: Advocate for government and philanthropic funding to flow directly to Indigenous‑led organizations, bypassing colonial intermediaries.
- **Educate Yourself & Others**: Learn about the history of colonialism, treaties, and Indigenous rights in Canada. Share what you learn.
- **Use Your Platform**: Amplify Indigenous voices, campaigns, and calls‑to‑action. Give credit and cite Indigenous sources.

### Don't:
- **Don't Appropriate Knowledge**: Traditional ecological knowledge belongs to Indigenous communities. Do not extract or commercialize it without explicit permission.
- **Don't Tokenize**: Avoid inviting Indigenous speakers merely to “check a diversity box.” Ensure they are properly compensated and that their participation aligns with their own goals.
- **Don't Assume One Size Fits All**: There are over 630 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities in Canada, each with distinct cultures, laws, and political contexts.
