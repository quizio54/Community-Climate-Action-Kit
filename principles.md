# Core Principles for a Just Transition

This document outlines the foundational principles that guide the Community Climate Action Kit. These principles are rooted in climate justice, Indigenous sovereignty, and systemic change.

## 1. Just Transition
A **Just Transition** means moving away from fossil fuels in a way that leaves no worker, community, or region behind. It requires:

- **Good Green Jobs**: Creating dignified, unionized work in renewable energy, public transit, building retrofits, and ecosystem restoration.
- **Community‑Led Planning**: Ensuring affected communities—especially workers in fossil‑fuel industries and frontline communities—have a decisive voice in transition plans.
- **Economic Diversification**: Public investment to build resilient local economies that are not dependent on extractive industries.

## 2. Indigenous Rights & Title
Respecting **Indigenous Rights & Title** is non‑negotiable for any legitimate climate action. This means:

- **Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)**: No energy or land‑use project can proceed without the explicit consent of the Indigenous Nations whose territories are impacted.
- **Land Back & Sovereignty**: Supporting the return of stolen land and the full exercise of Indigenous self‑determination.
- **Centering Indigenous Knowledge**: Valuing and learning from millennia‑old Indigenous science, land‑stewardship practices, and relational worldviews.

## 3. 100% Clean Economy by 2050
We advocate for a rapid, complete shift to a **100% clean economy by 2050**, with interim targets that keep global heating below 1.5 °C. This requires:

- **Phasing Out Fossil Fuels**: No new fossil‑fuel infrastructure (pipelines, mines, export terminals) and a managed decline of existing production.
- **100% Renewable Energy**: A democratically controlled energy system powered by wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable sources.
- **Energy Democracy**: Taking energy decision‑making out of corporate hands and placing it under community and public ownership.

## 4. Systemic Change
The climate crisis is not a technical problem but a symptom of a deeper **systemic crisis**. As Naomi Klein argues in *This Changes Everything*, we must confront the underlying logic of:

- **Extractivism**: An economic model that treats nature and people as disposable inputs for profit.
- **Colonialism & Racial Capitalism**: The historical and ongoing systems that concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few while exploiting Indigenous, Black, and racialized communities.
- **Growth‑at‑All‑Costs**: The false idea that endless economic growth on a finite planet is possible or desirable.

**Systemic change** means transforming our political and economic systems to prioritize well‑being, equity, and ecological limits over corporate profit.

## How to Use These Principles
- **In Campaigns**: Use these principles to evaluate policies, projects, and partnerships. Ask: “Does this advance a Just Transition? Does it respect Indigenous Rights? Does it move us toward a 100% clean economy? Does it challenge or reinforce the current system?”
- **In Education**: Share these principles in workshops, reading groups, and public talks to build a common understanding of what we’re fighting for.
- **In Solidarity**: Let these principles guide how we work together—with humility, reciprocity, and a commitment to collective liberation.
