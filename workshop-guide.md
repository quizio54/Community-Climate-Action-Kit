# Workshop Guide: Running a Climate‑Justice Introductory Session

This guide provides a step‑by‑step outline for a 1‑hour introductory workshop on climate justice and the Community Climate Action Kit. It is designed for organizers, educators, and community leaders who want to spark discussion, build shared understanding, and move people into action.

## Before the Workshop

### 1. Define Your Purpose
- **Why are you holding this workshop?** (e.g., to build a local climate‑justice coalition, to prepare for a campaign, to educate a group about Indigenous‑led solutions.)
- **Who is your audience?** (e.g., union members, students, faith groups, neighbourhood associations.)
- **What do you hope participants will leave with?** (e.g., a clear understanding of Just Transition, connections to local campaigns, concrete next steps.)

### 2. Gather Materials
- **Printed copies** of the [principles.md](principles.md) and [indigenous‑led‑solutions.md](indigenous-led-solutions.md) sheets (or digital links).
- **Sticky notes, markers, large paper, and tape** for group activities.
- **A laptop, projector, and speakers** for showing slides or videos (optional).
- **Snacks and drinks** to create a welcoming atmosphere.

### 3. Create a Safe & Inclusive Space
- **Land Acknowledgement**: Open with a meaningful acknowledgement of the Indigenous territory you are on. Name the local Nations and their treaties. Explain why this matters for climate justice.
- **Community Agreements**: Co‑create a short list of agreements with the group (e.g., “listen with respect,” “step up / step back,” “confidentiality,” “assume good intent”).
- **Accessibility**: Choose a wheelchair‑accessible venue, provide childcare if possible, offer materials in large print, and describe visuals for visually impaired participants.

## Workshop Outline (1 Hour)

### Welcome & Opening (5 minutes)
- **Greet people** as they arrive.
- **Land Acknowledgement** (see above).
- **Introduce yourself** and your connection to climate justice.
- **Explain the purpose** of the workshop and what participants can expect.

### Icebreaker: Climate Feelings (10 minutes)
- **Activity**: Ask each person to share **one word** that describes how they feel about the climate crisis. Go around the circle.
- **Why**: This surfaces emotions, builds empathy, and helps people realize they are not alone in their anxiety, grief, or hope.

### Part 1: What Is Climate Justice? (20 minutes)
- **Short Input** (10 min): Use slides or a flip‑chart to explain the **four core principles** (Just Transition, Indigenous Rights, 100% Clean Economy, Systemic Change). Refer to the [principles.md](principles.md) document.
- **Small‑Group Discussion** (10 min):
  - **Question 1**: “What does a Just Transition look like in our community?”
  - **Question 2**: “How can we centre Indigenous leadership in our climate work?”
  - Provide sticky notes for each group to capture key ideas.

### Part 2: Indigenous‑Led Solutions (15 minutes)
- **Showcase Examples** (7 min): Highlight 2–3 Indigenous‑led projects from the [indigenous‑led‑solutions.md](indigenous-led-solutions.md) fact sheet. Use photos or short video clips if available.
- **Pairs Discussion** (8 min):
  - **Prompt**: “What is one thing we can do as allies to support Indigenous‑led climate action?”
  - Have each pair share one idea with the whole group.

### Closing Circle & Next Steps (10 minutes)
- **Go‑Around**: Ask each person to share **one commitment** they are leaving with (e.g., “I will read the Indigenous‑led solutions sheet,” “I will join the next meeting of our local climate coalition,” “I will talk to my union about a Just Transition resolution.”)
- **Thank everyone** for their participation. Share contact information and links to relevant resources.
- **Collect feedback** (a quick written survey or verbal comments) to improve future workshops.

## Tips for Facilitators
- **Hold the Space, Don’t Dominate**: Your job is to guide the process, not provide all the answers. Let participants’ knowledge and experience shine.
- **Manage Time Gently**: Keep an eye on the clock, but be flexible if a discussion is particularly rich. You can always adjust on the fly.
- **Handle Conflict with Care**: If disagreements arise, refer back to the community agreements. Acknowledge different perspectives and steer the conversation toward common ground.
- **Follow Up**: Send a thank‑you email with the materials, notes from the workshop, and dates for next steps. This turns a one‑off event into an ongoing relationship.

## Adaptation Ideas
- **Shorter Version** (45 min): Focus on just one principle (e.g., Just Transition) and skip the action‑mapping.
- **Longer Version** (2–3 hours): Add a **skill‑share segment** (e.g., how to talk about climate justice with family, how to write a press release, how to lobby your MP).
- **Online Format**: Use breakout rooms for small‑group discussions, digital whiteboards (e.g., Miro, Jamboard) for the action‑mapping, and polls to keep engagement high.
