# Community Climate Action Kit

Welcome to the **Community Climate Action Kit** – a collaborative, open-source resource kit designed for community groups across Canada to advocate for a just and sustainable energy transition.

## Purpose
This kit provides grassroots organizers, students, local activists, and community leaders with the tools, frameworks, and educational materials needed to build effective climate justice campaigns grounded in:
- **Indigenous sovereignty and rights** – centering the leadership of Indigenous Nations in climate solutions.
- **A 100% clean economy by 2050** – advocating for a rapid, equitable transition away from fossil fuels.
- **Systemic change** – addressing the root causes of the climate crisis as articulated in Naomi Klein’s *This Changes Everything*.

## Guiding Principles
Our work is inspired by the analysis that climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a crisis of an economic system built on extraction, inequality, and colonial violence. A truly just transition requires:
1. **Respect for Indigenous Rights & Title** – Free, Prior and Informed Consent must guide all energy and land‑use decisions.
2. **A Fair & Inclusive Economy** – No worker or community left behind; good green jobs and public ownership of renewable energy.
3. **Climate Justice** – Those least responsible for the crisis must not bear its heaviest burdens.
4. **Democratizing Energy** – Moving decision‑making power from corporations to communities.

## Who Is This For?
- **Community organizers** looking to build local campaigns around energy democracy and climate justice.
- **Student groups** seeking educational resources and workshop materials.
- **Local activists** wanting to connect their work to broader movements for systemic change.
- **Anyone** who believes that a better world is possible and wants practical tools to help make it real.

## How to Use This Kit
The kit is organized into modules that can be used independently or as a whole:
